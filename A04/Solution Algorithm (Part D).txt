Problem Statement
        
Design and write program that asks the end-user to enter three test scores.
Create a function called calcAverage that accepts three test scores as arguments and returns the average of the scores.   	
          

Step 1. Nouns and Verbs. Identify the nouns and verbs in the problem statement and list them below
               

	Nouns: three test scores,  average

	Verbs:  asks, accepts, returns




Step 2. Defining Diagram. Convert the relevant nouns into variable names and the relevant verbs into processes.
          Write down the processes using short statements.
        

	INPUTS:
		testScore1
		testScore2
		testScore3
  

	PROCESSING:
		ask end-user for the first test score and save the input to the variable testScore1
		ask end-user for the second test score and save the input to the variable testScore2
		ask end-user for the third test score and save the input to the variable testScore3
		send the test scores to the function calcAverage to calculate the average
		return the average


	OUTPUTS:
		average
  


Step 3. Solution Algorithm. Create a solution algorithm. Separate out you pseudocode into methods, the steps inside each
	method should be sentence style pseudocode based on the defining diagram. Include valid Java variable data types and
	names that conform to our WITC Software Development Standards.

getScoreAverage(){
	declare and initialize double testScore1
	declare and initialize double testScore2
	declare and initialize double testScore3
	declare and initialize double average

	set testScore1 = getUserInput();
	set testScore2 = getUserInput();
	set testScore3 = getUserInput();

	set average = calcAverage(testScore1, testScore2, testScore3);

	displayResults(testScore1, testScore2, testScore3, average);	
}

double getUserInput(){
	declare and initialize double testScore

	declare and instantiate Scanner object

	prompt end-user for a test score and
	set input into the variable testScore

	return testScore;
}

double calcAverage(double num1, double num2, double num3){
	declare and initialize double average
	set average = (num1 + num2 + num 3) / 3

	return average;
}

displayResults(double num1, double num2, double num3, double average){
	display "Test score #1:" + " " + num1
	display "Test score #2:" + " " + num2
	display "Test score #3:" + " " + num3

	display "The average is:" + " " + average
}

Step 4. Checking the Solution Algorithm. Create a test plan for the algorithm.
	Remember to fill in the VARIABLES section! That's easy to miss!
        Have 2-3 test cases that test different inputs and outputs.  
          

	VARIABLES: 

	TEST CASE 1:

  		INPUT VALUES: 82, 87, 90

  		EXPECTED RESULT: 86.33
    
  		ACTUAL RESULT: 86.33333333333333

	TEST CASE 2:

  		INPUT VALUES: 70, 75, 80

  		EXPECTED RESULT: 75
    
  		ACTUAL RESULT: 75.0
    
	TEST CASE 3:

  		INPUT VALUES: 92, 94, 98

  		EXPECTED RESULT: 94.67
    
  		ACTUAL RESULT: 94.66666666666667


Step 5. Java Code. Using NetBeans, create the Java code based on your algorithm solution. 
	You will need to follow our WITC Software Development Standards.
	DO NOT PASTE YOUR CODE HERE. Turn in the project file from NetBeans.
  	Make sure you comment your code.
        
        
        

Step 6. Test Plan Revisited. Once everything is working, go back and fill in the actual results 
sections in the test plan. If you did not get your program to run, then your actual results should
reflect that. Better yet, contact me for help.
