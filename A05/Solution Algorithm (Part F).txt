ASSIGNMENT 5F

Problem Statement
        
Design and write Java program that will prompt the end-user for the price of an article and a pricing code. 
Your program then calculates a discount rate according to the pricing code and output to the page the original price of the article,
the discount amount and the new discounted price. Calculate the pricing code and accompanying discount amount as follows:

Pricing Code	Discount Rate
H				50%
F				40%
T				30%
Q				20%
Z				0%


Step 1. Nouns and Verbs. Identify the nouns and verbs in the problem statement and list them below
               

	Nouns: price of an article, pricing code, discount rate/amount, discounted price

	Verbs: prompt, calculates, output




Step 2. Defining Diagram. Convert the relevant nouns into variable names and the relevant verbs into processes.
          Write down the processes using short statements.
        

	INPUTS:
		articlePrice
		pricingCode
  

	PROCESSING:
		prompt the user for the price of an article
		prompt the user for the pricing code
		calculate the discount amount
		calculate the discounted price
		display the article price, the discount amount, and the new discounted price
  

	OUTPUTS:
		articlePrice
		discountAmount
		totalPrice


Step 3. Solution Algorithm. Create a solution algorithm. Separate out you pseudocode into methods, the steps inside each
	method should be sentence style pseudocode based on the defining diagram. Include valid Java variable data types and
	names that conform to our WITC Software Development Standards.

calcDiscount(){
	declare and initialize double articlePrice
	declare and initialize String pricingCode
	declare and initialize double discountAmount
	declare and initialize double totalPrice
	declare and initialize String message

	set message = "Enter the price of the article."
	set articlePrice = stringToReal(getUserInput(message))

	set message = "Enter the pricing code."
	set pricingCode = getUserInput(message)

	CASE OF pricingCode
		H: discountAmount = articlePrice * 0.5
		F: discountAmount = articlePrice * 0.4
		T: discountAmount = articlePrice * 0.3
		Q: discountAmount = articlePrice * 0.2
		Z: discountAmount = 0
	ENDCASE

	set totalPrice = articlePrice - discountAmount

	message = "Original Price: $" + articlePrice
	call displayResults(message);
	message = "Discount Amount: $" + discountAmount
	call displayResults(message);
	message = "Discounted Price: $" + totalPrice
	call displayResults(message);
}

String getUserInput(String message){
	declare and initialize String userInput

	declare and instantiate Scanner object

	prompt end-user with message and
	set input into the variable userInput

	return userInput;
}

displayResults(String message){
	display message
}


Step 4. Checking the Solution Algorithm. Create a test plan for the algorithm.
	Remember to fill in the VARIABLES section! That's easy to miss!
        Have 2-3 test cases that test different inputs and outputs.  
          

	VARIABLES: articlePrice, pricingCode, discountAmount, totalPrice

	TEST CASE 1:

  		INPUT VALUES: 15.00, t

  		EXPECTED RESULT: 15.00, 4.50, 10.50
    
  		ACTUAL RESULT: 15.00, 4.50, 10.50

	TEST CASE 2:

  		INPUT VALUES: 2.50, H

  		EXPECTED RESULT: 2.50, 1.25, 1.25
    
  		ACTUAL RESULT: 2.50, 1.25, 1.25
    
	TEST CASE 3:

  		INPUT VALUES: 14.00, Z

  		EXPECTED RESULT: "No Discount.", 14.00, 0 ,14.00
    
  		ACTUAL RESULT: "No Discount.", 14.00, 0.00, 14.00


Step 5. Java Code. Using NetBeans, create the Java code based on your algorithm solution. 
	You will need to follow our WITC Software Development Standards.
	DO NOT PASTE YOUR CODE HERE. Turn in the project file from NetBeans.
  	Make sure you comment your code.
        
        
        

Step 6. Test Plan Revisited. Once everything is working, go back and fill in the actual results 
sections in the test plan. If you did not get your program to run, then your actual results should
reflect that. Better yet, contact me for help.
