ASSIGNMENT 5B

Problem Statement
        
Design and write a Java program that asks the end-user if today is their birthday.
If the answer is yes, display Happy Birthday. If the answer is not yes, display Make it a Great Day.     	
          

Step 1. Nouns and Verbs. Identify the nouns and verbs in the problem statement and list them below
               

	Nouns: answer, yes

	Verbs: asks, [compare], display




Step 2. Defining Diagram. Convert the relevant nouns into variable names and the relevant verbs into processes.
          Write down the processes using short statements.
        

	INPUTS:
		answer
		yes
  

	PROCESSING:
		ask if it's the user's birthday
		compare input to yes
		display message "happy birthday" if answer is yes
		else display message "make it a great day"
  

	OUTPUTS:
		message


Step 3. Solution Algorithm. Create a solution algorithm. Separate out you pseudocode into methods, the steps inside each
	method should be sentence style pseudocode based on the defining diagram. Include valid Java variable data types and
	names that conform to our WITC Software Development Standards.

checkBirthday(){
	declare and initialize String answer
	declare and initialize String message

	set message = "Is today your birthday?"
	set answer = getUserInput(message)

	IF(answer is equal to yes){
		set message = "Happy Birthday!"
		call displayResults(message);
	ELSE
		set message = "Make it a Great Day!"
		call displayResults(message);
	}
}

String getUserInput(String message){
	declare and initialize String userInput

	declare and instantiate Scanner object

	prompt end-user with message and
	set input into the variable userInput

	return userInput;
}

displayResults(String message){
	display message
}


Step 4. Checking the Solution Algorithm. Create a test plan for the algorithm.
	Remember to fill in the VARIABLES section! That's easy to miss!
        Have 2-3 test cases that test different inputs and outputs.  
          

	VARIABLES: answer, message

	TEST CASE 1:

  		INPUT VALUES: Yes

  		EXPECTED RESULT: Happy Birthday!
    
  		ACTUAL RESULT: Happy Birthday!

	TEST CASE 2:

  		INPUT VALUES: No

  		EXPECTED RESULT: Make it a Great Day!
    
  		ACTUAL RESULT: Make it a Great Day!
    
	TEST CASE 3:

  		INPUT VALUES: YES

  		EXPECTED RESULT: Happy Birthday!
    
  		ACTUAL RESULT: Happy Birthday!


Step 5. Java Code. Using NetBeans, create the Java code based on your algorithm solution. 
	You will need to follow our WITC Software Development Standards.
	DO NOT PASTE YOUR CODE HERE. Turn in the project file from NetBeans.
  	Make sure you comment your code.
        
        
        

Step 6. Test Plan Revisited. Once everything is working, go back and fill in the actual results 
sections in the test plan. If you did not get your program to run, then your actual results should
reflect that. Better yet, contact me for help.
